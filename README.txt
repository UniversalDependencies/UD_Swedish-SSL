The Universal Dependencies treebank for Swedish Sign Language (ISO 639-3: swl)
is derived from the Swedish Sign Language Corpus (SSLC) from the department of
linguistics, Stockholm University:

    http://www.ling.su.se/english/research/research-projects/sign-language

Selected portions of SSLC have been manually annotated according to our
adapted version of the Universal Dependencies guidelines.

Syntactic annotation is mainly due to Moa Gärdenfors with assistance from Carl
Börstell and Mats Wiren. Carl Börstell, Robert Östling and Lars Wallin have
contributed to the part-of-speech annotations. Robert Östling has contributed
software for converting between the annotation format (ELAN) and CoNLL-U.
